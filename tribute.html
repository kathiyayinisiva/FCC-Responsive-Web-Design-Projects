He <strong>authored a book that is widely prescribed as a textbook today, titled 'History of Indian Culture'</strong>. During this period where he eventually was elected as <strong>the Principal and President of the college</strong>, he inspired and encouraged hundreds of students from his town to take up education, a time when farming was the way to go.
